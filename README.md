As a means to teach me how to write python for Maya and just python in general, I am making a big script of functions to make rigging in Maya much faster for me. The script will include ...

*Features being worked on are as follows*
  - Creating a nurbs curve control creation tool for joints
  - Creating a Ribbon Rig creation tool
  - Creating a Control panel creation tool
      - can make sliders and XY panels for controls on the control panel
      - A name is also generated

*Future features may include*
  - Rewrite te UI in QT to learn about that next, as the default Maya UI layout controls are rather finicky
  - make a control creation preview so before we hit apply we can rotate and scale the controls as we edit them
